# Intruder-WatchDog
Right after my graduation I Developed a System which detects Intruder in a home environment and Alert Owner/Administrator by Call, SMS and WhatsApp using OpenCV, Convolutional neural networks, and Twilio API.

Step 1 : Install OpenCV,PIL,selenium,twilio,numpy
Step2 : Download and install Chrome Driver

" In the code....We need to change the paths ".

Application : This project alerts owner/ administrator with 5 different features whenever, intruder is found.
Feature1 : Call
Feature2 : SMS
Feature3 : WhatsApp Messages
Feature4 : Location Of Intruder.

I also want to work more on this in free time and develop more features in the project like picture of the intruder sent to owner and send aleart direectly to emergency services.
